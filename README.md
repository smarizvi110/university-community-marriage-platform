# 💍 University Community Marriage Platform

This project aims to connect Shi'a students at our university with potential spouses in a safe and respectful environment. It is organized into three separate repositories to maintain modularity and clarity.

## 📂 Repositories

- **[Backend](https://github.com/smarizvi110/university-community-marriage-platform-backend)**: Handles user authentication, profile management, and connection requests.
- **[Legal Documents](https://github.com/smarizvi110/university-community-marriage-platform-legal)**: Contains all legal documents, including Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.

## 🏗️ Project Structure

Each repository is independent, allowing for flexibility in development and deployment:
- **Backend**: Developed in Rust with Axum and SQLx.
- **Legal Documents**: Essential policies for user data, conduct, and legal compliance.

Check each repository for specific setup instructions and contributing guidelines.
